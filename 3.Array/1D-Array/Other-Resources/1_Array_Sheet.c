THEORY :
	Technique To Solve Array Question
						
						
	TWO POINTERS: //It involves using two pointers, usually starting from opposite ends of the array, and moving them towards each other until they meet or satisfy a specific condition.

	SLIDING WINDOW: //It is a technique that involves maintaining a set of elements in a contiguous subarray. The window is shifted or resized based on certain conditions to solve the problem efficiently.

	PREFIX SUM: //This technique involves precomputing and storing the cumulative sum of elements in an array. It helps in performing range queries or finding subarray sums quickly.

	TWO-SUM TECHNIQUE: //It is used to find pairs of elements in an array that sum up to a specific target value. It typically involves using a hash table or sorting the array to solve the problem efficiently.

	DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING: //This technique is used when the problem can be divided into overlapping subproblems. By storing the results of subproblems, dynamic programming reduces the time complexity and solves the problem optimally.

	DIVIDE AND CONQUERE: // It involves breaking down a problem into smaller subproblems, solving them independently, and then combining the results to obtain the final solution.

	BACKTRACKING: //It is a technique that involves exploring all possible solutions by trying out different options and undoing choices if they do not lead to a valid solution.	
	
	
	
	LINEAR SEARCH : // It is a simple technique where each element in the array is compared sequentially until a match is found or the end of the array is reached.

	BINARY SEARCH: //This technique is applicable only on sorted arrays. It involves repeatedly dividing the search interval in half until the target element is foun

	SORTING: //Sometimes sorting an array can help in solving the problem more efficiently. Sorting can enable techniques like binary search or two pointers.
