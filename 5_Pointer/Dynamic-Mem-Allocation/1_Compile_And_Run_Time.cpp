    1.Recipe : Code
    2.Ingredients : Programming instruction
    3.Chef : Compiler
    4.Chef Preparing Food seeing receipe(Yo Time) : Compilation Time (I think Constant Time)
    5.Cooked Dish : Compiled Program (like .exe file )

    7.RunTime : (Variable Time)
    It starts when you launch or run a program and continues 
    until the program completes its tasks, is closed, or is terminated. D


    ----------------------Story-----------------------------------------------

    Imagine you have a recipe (your code) with a list of ingredients (programming instructions) 
    and steps to follow. 
    When you compile, it's as if you give the recipe to a chef (the compiler), and the chef 
    follows the instructions, preparing a finished dish (the compiled program) that you can 
    serve (run) on a plate (your computer). 

    During this process, the chef checks if the recipe is written correctly and makes sure all 
    the ingredients are in the right order. If there's a mistake or something is missing, the 
    chef (compiler) will let you know, so you can fix it before serving the final dish (running 
    the program). Once everything is correct, you have a delicious meal (compiled program) that
    can be enjoyed by your computer.
